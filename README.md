# cMAp_Terzi


# This is data from connectivety map
## Part1: RNA seq
It was performed with R on Data from EGF-Tgfa Nx mice.
The significant changes are stored in *tgfa_fixed2_parent_ShamvsNx_res_mouse.csv*

## Part2: cMAP
Data where downloaded from **GSE92742**, and analyzed with python/cmapPy. file is a file that can be modified by Jupyter notebook (Anaconda) or Google Colab

## Part3: Results
Saved in PowerPoint presentation format


## To compare with cMAP site
cMAP site is able to test list of upregulated and downregulated genes against their database. The results are **very different** that what the analysis shows.
A list of scores are saved in "clue_cMAP_HA1E_vs_Terzi.txt"
